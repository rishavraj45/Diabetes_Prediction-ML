Diabetes Prediction using support vector machine (SVM) - Classification based prediction.

**Support Vector Machines**:A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points into different classes, maximizing the margin between them. SVMs are particularly effective for high-dimensional data and can handle both linear and non-linear relationships using kernel functions.
